Write a paragraph or two about some phenomenon you have observed that you think might be explained mathematically. Explain what patterns you have observed and any ideas that you have about mathematical formulas or equations that might describe them. [I am not asking for a polished analysis here, just want you to start thinking about mathematical modeling and about how to express your ideas clearly.].

Crystallographic structures are a microscopic mathematical phenomena. A scanning probe is necessary to capture their structures. Though there is noise collected in the data, pseudo-symmetries can be analyzed mathematically once the noise is filtered. I would imagine the analytical approach to classification of the crystallographic images into space groups would require linear algebra. This analysis actually presents a big issue to the materials science community, as the analytical approach is extremely computationally heavy. Nowdays, scientists are working on resolving this problem by leveraging and improving machine learning techniques. 

Another example would be the study of the polarization of political parties in a bipartisan state. This falls under the field of complexity, as the systems require nonlinear mathematical modeling. To model this phenomena, differential equations are used.
