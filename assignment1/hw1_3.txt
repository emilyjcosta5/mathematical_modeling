1. A man whose end was approaching summoned his sons and said, "Divide my money as I shall prescribe." To his eldest son, he said, "you are to have 1 bezant and a seventh of what is left." To his second son, he said, "Take 2 bezants and a seventh of what remains." To the third son, he said, "You are to take 3 bezants and a seventh of what is left." Thus he gave each son 1 bezant more than the previous son and a seventh of what remained, and to the last son all that was left. After following their father's instructions with care, the sons found that they had shared their inheritance equally. How many sons were there, and how large was the estate?

2. a. Show Golden Ratio continued fraction. (hint: x^2 = x + 1 satisfies Golden Ratio, use x = 1 + 1/x)
   b. Show sqrt(2) continued fraction. (hint: x^2 = 2x + 1 satisfies sqrt(2))

4. Eagles fly in a trajectory keeping the same angle, 40 degrees, between its tangent and the direct line to the prey. Show that the requirement of constant angles yields a trajectory that is in the form of a logarithmic spiral, r=a*e^(b*theta), where r is the radial distance to the prey and theta is the azimuthal angle.

1. 
  i.   Solve for the total estate by finding the first and second sons' inheritance. Let x represent the total of the estate.
  First son: x-(1+(x-1)/7) = (6/7)(x-1)
  Second son: 2+(1/7)((6/7)(x-1)-2) = (6/7)((x/7)+(13/7))
  ii.  Set the two equations equal to each other and solve for x. We get that x = 36, or the total estate is 36 bezants.
  iii. Now, to figure out how many sons, we figure out the size of the first son's inheritance then divide the total estate by that number (as it is divided equally).
  First son: 1+(36-1)/7 = 6 bezants
  Total sons: 36/6 = 6 total sons 

2.
  a. As the Golden Ratio can be expressed as x = 1 + 1/x, we can continuously plug in x to the right hand side as such: 
  phi = 1+(1/(1+1/(1+1/1+1/...)))

  1 + 1

    1 + 1
       ---
      1 + 1
         ---
        1 + 1
           ---
           ...

  b. sqrt(2) can be expressed as x = 2 + 1/x, so we can also continuously plus in x to the right hand side as suchL
  sqrt(2) = 2+(1/(2+1/(2+1/(2+1/...)))) 

  2 + 1

    2 + 1

      2 + 1
